Okay, since the БПЭК-03/ЦК is appearing as **COM3**, the next step is to monitor the data flowing through that specific virtual serial port while the "Газсеть - Cчитывание данных" software is actively communicating with it.

You need software that can "spy" on or monitor a COM port that another application is using. Standard terminal programs (like PuTTY or RealTerm) usually can't connect to a port already opened by another program.

**Tools for Monitoring COM Port Data:**

Here are a few options, ranging from free to paid (often with free trials):

1.  **Eltima Serial Port Monitor (Recommended - Commercial, Free Trial):**
    *   One of the most popular and feature-rich tools for this.
    *   Allows you to monitor ports already opened by other applications.
    *   Provides multiple views (Terminal, Table, Dump, Line) to see the data in different formats (ASCII, HEX, Decimal, etc.).
    *   Can log data clearly showing Tx (Transmitted by Gazset) and Rx (Received from BPEK).
    *   *Website:* Search for "Eltima Serial Port Monitor"

2.  **AGG Software Advanced Serial Port Monitor (Commercial, Free Trial):**
    *   Similar capabilities to Eltima's tool.
    *   Good for monitoring and analyzing serial data streams.
    *   *Website:* Search for "AGG Software Advanced Serial Port Monitor"

3.  **HHD Software Free Serial Port Monitor (Free Version Available):**
    *   Offers a free version, which might be sufficient for basic monitoring, although advanced features might be limited compared to paid versions.
    *   Can monitor ports opened by other applications.
    *   *Website:* Search for "HHD Software Free Serial Port Monitor"

4.  **IO Ninja (Commercial, Free Tier/Trial):**
    *   A more general-purpose I/O terminal but has robust serial port sniffing capabilities.
    *   Steeper learning curve but very powerful.

**General Steps Using a Serial Port Monitor (e.g., Eltima's):**

1.  **Install the Monitor Software:** Download and install your chosen tool. You might need administrator privileges.
2.  **Close "Газсеть" Software:** Ensure the "Газсеть" application is completely closed so it doesn't currently have COM3 open.
3.  **Launch the Monitor Software:** Run the serial port monitor tool (e.g., Serial Port Monitor).
4.  **Start a New Monitoring Session:**
    *   Go to "Session" -> "New session" or a similar menu option.
    *   Select the COM port you want to monitor: **COM3**.
    *   Make sure the options to capture Read, Write, and Control operations are enabled.
    *   Choose the visualizers you want (Table view, Dump view, and Terminal view are often useful).
    *   Click "Start monitoring".
5.  **Launch "Газсеть" Software:** Now, open the "Газсеть - Cчитывание данных" application.
6.  **Connect to БПЭК in "Газсеть":** Use the "Газсеть" software to connect to the БПЭК device (which it knows is on COM3).
7.  **Perform Actions in "Газсеть":** Perform the specific actions you want to reverse-engineer:
    *   Connect/Authenticate (if separate steps).
    *   Read device status or basic info.
    *   Read configuration parameters.
    *   Read hourly archive data.
    *   Read daily archive data.
    *   Read event logs.
    *   *(Try to do one distinct action at a time to make analysis easier).*
8.  **Observe the Monitor:** As you perform actions in "Газсеть", you should see data appearing in the serial port monitor tool.
    *   Look for data packets being sent **TO** COM3 (Tx/Write - from "Газсеть").
    *   Look for data packets being received **FROM** COM3 (Rx/Read - from БПЭК).
    *   The data will likely be shown in Hexadecimal format in the "Dump" or "Table" view, which is typical for binary protocols. The "Terminal" view might show some readable ASCII characters if any exist in the protocol, but don't rely on it.
9.  **Stop Monitoring and Save:** Once you have captured the interactions for the actions you're interested in, stop the monitoring session in the tool and **save the log file**. Most tools allow exporting the captured data.

**What to Look For in the Captured Data:**

*   **Request/Response Pairs:** Try to match a packet sent by "Газсеть" (request) with the subsequent packet(s) received from the БПЭК (response).
*   **Packet Structure:** Look for consistent start/end bytes, length fields, command codes, device addresses, data payloads, and checksums (often 1 or 2 bytes at the end, like CRC).
*   **Binary Data:** Focus on the Hexadecimal representation.
*   **Correlation:** Note down exactly what action you performed in "Газсеть" just before a specific request packet was sent.

This captured serial data is the raw material you need to start deciphering the actual communication protocol between the software and the БПЭК. Good luck!
