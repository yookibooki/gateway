Okay, since the БПЭК-03/ЦК is appearing as **COM3**, the next step is to monitor the data flowing through that specific virtual serial port while the "Газсеть - Cчитывание данных" software is actively communicating with it.

You need software that can "spy" on or monitor a COM port that another application is using. Standard terminal programs (like PuTTY or RealTerm) usually can't connect to a port already opened by another program.

**Tools for Monitoring COM Port Data:**

Here are a few options, ranging from free to paid (often with free trials):

1.  **Eltima Serial Port Monitor (Recommended - Commercial, Free Trial):**
    *   One of the most popular and feature-rich tools for this.
    *   Allows you to monitor ports already opened by other applications.

**General Steps Using a Serial Port Monitor (e.g., Eltima's):**

1.  **Install the Monitor Software:** Download and install your chosen tool. You might need administrator privileges.
2.  **Close "Газсеть" Software:** Ensure the "Газсеть" application is completely closed so it doesn't currently have COM3 open.
3.  **Launch the Monitor Software:** Run the serial port monitor tool (e.g., Serial Port Monitor).
4.  **Start a New Monitoring Session:**
    *   Go to "Session" -> "New session" or a similar menu option.
    *   Select the COM port you want to monitor: **COM3**.
    *   Make sure the options to capture Read, Write, and Control operations are enabled.
    *   Choose the visualizers you want (Table view, Dump view, and Terminal view are often useful).
    *   Click "Start monitoring".
5.  **Launch "Газсеть" Software:** Now, open the "Газсеть - Cчитывание данных" application.
6.  **Connect to БПЭК in "Газсеть":** Use the "Газсеть" software to connect to the БПЭК device (which it knows is on COM3).
7.  **Perform Actions in "Газсеть":** Perform the specific actions you want to reverse-engineer:
    *   Connect/Authenticate (if separate steps).
    *   Read device status or basic info.
    *   Read configuration parameters.
    *   Read hourly archive data.
    *   Read daily archive data.
    *   Read event logs.
    *   *(Try to do one distinct action at a time to make analysis easier).*
8.  **Observe the Monitor:** As you perform actions in "Газсеть", you should see data appearing in the serial port monitor tool.
    *   Look for data packets being sent **TO** COM3 (Tx/Write - from "Газсеть").
    *   Look for data packets being received **FROM** COM3 (Rx/Read - from БПЭК).
    *   The data will likely be shown in Hexadecimal format in the "Dump" or "Table" view, which is typical for binary protocols. The "Terminal" view might show some readable ASCII characters if any exist in the protocol, but don't rely on it.
9.  **Stop Monitoring and Save:** Once you have captured the interactions for the actions you're interested in, stop the monitoring session in the tool and **save the log file**. Most tools allow exporting the captured data.

**What to Look For in the Captured Data:**

*   **Request/Response Pairs:** Try to match a packet sent by "Газсеть" (request) with the subsequent packet(s) received from the БПЭК (response).
*   **Packet Structure:** Look for consistent start/end bytes, length fields, command codes, device addresses, data payloads, and checksums (often 1 or 2 bytes at the end, like CRC).
*   **Binary Data:** Focus on the Hexadecimal representation.
*   **Correlation:** Note down exactly what action you performed in "Газсеть" just before a specific request packet was sent.

This captured serial data is the raw material you need to start deciphering the actual communication protocol between the software and the БПЭК. Good luck!

Okay, let's analyze this USB capture log.

**Key Observations:**

1.  **Multiple Devices:** The log shows interactions with several USB devices (`1.2.0`, `1.3.0`, `1.7.0`, `1.8.0`). USB addresses are typically `Bus.Device.Endpoint`.
2.  **Device Enumeration:** The initial packets (1-12, 13-26, 35-40) are standard USB enumeration sequences:
    *   `GET DESCRIPTOR DEVICE`: Host asks for basic device info.
    *   `GET DESCRIPTOR CONFIGURATION`: Host asks for configuration details (interfaces, endpoints).
    *   `SET CONFIGURATION`: Host selects a configuration to use.
    *   `SET INTERFACE`: Host selects an interface within the configuration.
3.  **БПЭК-03/ЦК Identification (Likely Device 1.7.x):**
    *   Packets 13-34 relate to device `1.7.0`.
    *   Crucially, packets 27-34 use the `USBCOM` protocol (specifically, USB CDC-ACM class requests):
        *   `GET LINE CODING`: Requesting serial port parameters (baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits).
        *   `SET CONTROL LINE STATE`: Setting DTR/RTS signals, typical for serial communication readiness.
        *   `SET LINE CODING`: Setting the serial parameters (likely 19200 8N1 based on the manual).
    *   **Conclusion:** This strongly indicates that the **БПЭК-03/ЦК connects as a standard USB Virtual COM Port (VCP)**. This is good news, as it means you can interact with it using standard serial port libraries once you know the protocol.

4.  **Security Key Identification (Likely Device 1.8.x):**
    *   Packets 35 onwards relate mostly to device `1.8.0` and its endpoint `1.8.3`.
    *   This device *does not* use `USBCOM` requests after enumeration.
    *   Instead, there's a lot of traffic using:
        *   `URB_CONTROL out/in`: These are typically used for vendor-specific control commands sent to/from Endpoint 0.
        *   `URB_INTERRUPT in`: This indicates the device sends data asynchronously to the host via an Interrupt endpoint (`1.8.3` in this case).
    *   **Conclusion:** Device `1.8.x` behaves like a typical **USB security key (dongle)**. It uses custom control commands and interrupt transfers for its challenge-response mechanism with the "Газсеть" software.

5.  **Interaction Flow:**
    *   The БПЭК (`1.7.0`) is enumerated and configured as a COM port around `t=12.8s`.
    *   The security key (`1.8.0`) is enumerated around `t=21.3s`.
    *   Significant communication with the **security key** (`1.8.x`) starts around `t=39.4s` and continues extensively.
    *   **Crucially, there is NO data transfer shown over the virtual COM port associated with the БПЭК (`1.7.x`) in this log.** All the later `URB_CONTROL` and `URB_INTERRUPT` packets are directed to the security key (`1.8.x`).

**Interpretation and Next Steps:**

1.  **Confirmation:** The БПЭК uses a standard Virtual COM Port driver. When you plug it in, Windows/Linux should create a COM port (e.g., COM3, COM4, /dev/ttyACM0, /dev/ttyUSB0). You need to identify this port.
2.  **The Security Key is Essential:** This log strongly suggests that the "Газсеть" software performs checks with the security key (`1.8.x`) *before* or *while* attempting to communicate meaningful data with the БПЭК over its virtual COM port (`1.7.x`). The extensive traffic to `1.8.x` confirms the key is actively used.
3.  **Missing Data Protocol:** This capture **does not show the actual data protocol** used to talk to the БПЭК over the virtual COM port. It only shows the USB-level setup and the security key interactions.
4.  **Reverse Engineering Challenge:**
    *   **БПЭК Protocol:** You need to capture the data flowing through the **virtual COM port** associated with device `1.7.x` while "Газсеть" is reading data. Use a serial port monitoring tool (like RealTerm, Hterm, Termite, or specialized software like Serial Port Monitor by Eltima) for this. This will reveal the actual commands and responses (likely binary packets).
    *   **Security Key Protocol:** Replicating the security key's behavior (`1.8.x` traffic) is a **major hurdle**. This requires reverse-engineering the custom `URB_CONTROL` commands and understanding the `URB_INTERRUPT` data. This is often significantly harder than sniffing a serial protocol and might require specialized tools. Your custom software will likely fail if it cannot satisfy the security key check demanded by either the БПЭК firmware itself or the protocol sequence expected by it.

**In summary:**

*   You've confirmed the БПЭК uses a standard Virtual COM Port interface.
*   You've confirmed the USB security key is actively used and essential for the official software.
*   **Your next step is to capture the serial data on the virtual COM port** created by the БПЭК while the official software is running, to see the *actual* communication protocol.
*   Be prepared that bypassing or replicating the security key interaction will be very difficult and might be the main obstacle.


Okay, let's analyze this initial USB capture.

**Analysis of the Capture Data:**

1.  **Multiple Devices:** The capture shows interactions with several USB devices: `1.2.0`, `1.3.0`, `1.7.0`, and `1.8.0` (with endpoint `1.8.3`).
    *   Devices `1.2.0` and `1.3.0` are enumerated right at the beginning (packets 1-12). One of these is almost certainly your **USB security key**. The software likely checks for its presence before fully initializing or allowing connection to the БПЭК.
    *   Device `1.7.0` is enumerated around 12.8 seconds (packets 13-34). This looks like the **БПЭК-03/ЦК** itself.
    *   Device `1.8.0` / `1.8.3` is enumerated around 21.3 seconds (packets 35-46). This is less clear - it could be another interface on the БПЭК, or perhaps interaction with the security key *after* the БПЭК is detected.

2.  **USB CDC ACM (Virtual COM Port):**
    *   Packets 27-34 clearly show the host interacting with device `1.7.0` using `USBCOM` protocol requests: `GET LINE CODING`, `SET CONTROL LINE STATE`, `SET LINE CODING`.
    *   This is standard procedure for setting up a **USB Communications Device Class (CDC) Abstract Control Model (ACM)** device. In simple terms, the БПЭК is telling the PC "I am a serial port (COM port)".
    *   The `SET LINE CODING` request (packet 31) is where the "Газсеть" software tells the БПЭК what serial parameters to use (baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits - likely 19200 8N1 based on the manual's Appendix Г).
    *   `SET CONTROL LINE STATE` (packet 29) is often used to signal DTR (Data Terminal Ready) and RTS (Request To Send), effectively "opening" the virtual serial port.

3.  **Idle Traffic (Packets ~47 onwards):**
    *   Most of the subsequent traffic involves device `1.8.0` and endpoint `1.8.3`.
    *   You see a repeating pattern of `URB_CONTROL out`, `URB_INTERRUPT in`, and `URB_CONTROL in` requests/responses.
    *   `URB_INTERRUPT in` is often used for low-latency status updates or by HID (Human Interface Devices). This traffic might be:
        *   The software periodically polling the **security key** (`1.8.0`?) to ensure it's still present.
        *   The software polling the **БПЭК** (`1.8.0`?) for basic status via control transfers (less common for bulk data).
    *   **Crucially Missing:** There are **no `URB_BULK out` or `URB_BULK in` packets** associated with device `1.7.0` (the virtual COM port) after the initial setup. Bulk transfers are how actual serial data is typically sent and received over USB CDC ACM.

**Conclusion and Next Steps:**

This capture successfully shows:
*   The enumeration of multiple devices (likely БПЭК and security key).
*   The БПЭК (`1.7.0`) identifying itself as a virtual COM port.
*   The software configuring the serial parameters for that COM port.
*   Some form of idle polling or keep-alive happening, likely involving the security key or a basic status check on device `1.8.0`.

**However, this capture DOES NOT contain the actual data communication protocol used to read archives or configuration from the БПЭК.** Because you left the software idle, it wasn't sending commands to request data over the virtual COM port (`1.7.0`), and therefore the БПЭК wasn't sending data back.

**YES, you absolutely need to perform operations in the software while capturing.**

**Recommended Actions While Capturing:**

1.  **Connect:** Start capture, connect to the БПЭК in the "Газсеть" software (establish the connection to COM3).
2.  **Read Current Values:** Perform an action like "Read current measurements" or "Read instantaneous values". Capture this.
3.  **Read Configuration:** Read some basic configuration parameters (e.g., device serial number, time, SIM card settings). Capture this.
4.  **Read Archive Data:** This is key. Perform an action to read a small portion of an archive (e.g., "Read last 10 hourly records", "Read daily archive for yesterday"). Capture this.
5.  **Disconnect:** Disconnect from the device in the software. Capture this.

**Focus Your Analysis:**

*   Once you have captures with actual operations, **filter the Wireshark display** to focus *only* on traffic involving the USB device identified as the virtual COM port (which appears to be `1.7.0` in this initial capture, but double-check its address in subsequent captures).
*   Look specifically for **`URB_BULK out`** packets (host sending commands to the device) and **`URB_BULK in`** packets (device sending responses/data back to the host) associated with that device (`1.7.0`).
*   Analyze the **data payload** within these bulk transfers. This is where you will find the proprietary commands and responses you need to reverse engineer.
