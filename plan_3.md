However, this is likely to be a **challenging task** primarily because:

1.  **Proprietary Protocol:** The communication protocol used between the "Газсеть" software (both "Стандарт" and "Сервис" for configuration) and the БПЭК-03/ЦК over the USB connection (and potentially the remote CSD/TCP connections) is almost certainly **proprietary and undocumented** by the manufacturer (Техномер). They have a commercial interest in selling their software licenses.
2.  **Complexity:** Industrial protocols can be complex, involving specific command structures, data encoding, error checking (like CRC), and session management.

**Here's a breakdown of what's involved and the approaches you could take:**

**1. Identify the Communication Interface:**

*   **Local Configuration/Data Download:** The primary interface for direct PC connection is **USB**, as shown in the diagrams and manual (Appendix Г). The device likely presents itself as a virtual COM port (Serial over USB) or possibly a custom USB device class. You'll need to determine this using your operating system's device manager when the БПЭК is connected.
*   **Remote Communication:** This uses CSD or GPRS (TCP/FTP). Intercepting and replicating this is much harder as it involves the cellular network and the server-side infrastructure. Replicating the *local* USB communication is the more feasible starting point.
*   **External RS485 (Newer Models):** If your БПЭК-03/ЦК is a newer model (released after July 2022, potentially with the RS485 port shown in Fig 2b, Fig 3, Fig 4, Appendix Г Fig Г11), there's a *small chance* this port might use a standard protocol like Modbus RTU for *some* data access, separate from the main configuration/archive download protocol over USB. This is worth investigating but don't count on it for full functionality.

**2. Reverse Engineering the Protocol (Most Likely Path):**

This is the standard approach when official documentation is unavailable.

*   **USB Sniffing:**
    *   You need to capture the data exchanged between the official "Газсеть" software and the БПЭК-03/ЦК over the USB connection.
    *   **Tools:** Use USB sniffing software. Examples include:
        *   Wireshark (with the USBPcap extension on Windows)
        *   USBlyzer
        *   Free USB Analyzer
        *   Linux has built-in USB monitoring capabilities (`usbmon`).
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Start the sniffing tool and select the USB device corresponding to the БПЭК.
        2.  Perform various actions in the "Газсеть" software (connect, read configuration, read specific archive data, read sensor status, attempt to write a parameter, etc.).
        3.  Capture the raw USB traffic for each action.
        4.  **Analyze the captured data:** This is the hardest part. You need to look for patterns:
            *   Are commands sent in ASCII or binary?
            *   What is the structure of a request packet? (e.g., start byte, device address, function code, data length, data payload, checksum/CRC).
            *   What is the structure of a response packet?
            *   How are different data types (integers, floats, strings, timestamps) encoded?
            *   Identify specific command codes for different actions (e.g., "read hourly archive", "read configuration parameter X", "write parameter Y").
            *   Figure out the checksum/CRC algorithm used for error checking.

*   **Serial Port Monitoring (If USB acts as Virtual COM):** If the USB connection creates a virtual COM port, you can use serial port monitoring tools (like RealTerm, Hterm, Termite, or even custom scripts with libraries like PySerial in Python) in conjunction with a virtual serial port splitter/monitor to intercept the data flow between "Газсеть" and the virtual COM port. The analysis process remains the same.

**3. Development:**

*   Once you have a decent understanding of the protocol (at least for the functions you need), you can start writing your own software.
*   You'll need a programming language with good support for serial/USB communication (e.g., Python with PySerial/PyUSB, C#/.NET with `System.IO.Ports` or LibUsbDotNet, C++ with relevant libraries).
*   Implement functions to:
    *   Establish the connection (open COM port or USB device).
    *   Construct request packets according to the reverse-engineered protocol.
    *   Send requests.
    *   Receive responses.
    *   Parse the response data.
    *   Validate checksums/CRCs.
    *   Present the data to the user or store it.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

*   **Time and Skill:** Reverse engineering is time-consuming and requires strong technical skills in programming, low-level communication protocols, and data analysis.
*   **Incompleteness:** You might only figure out parts of the protocol relevant to your immediate needs.
*   **Firmware Updates:** If Техномер updates the firmware on the БПЭК-03/ЦК, they might change the protocol, breaking your software.
*   **Error Handling:** The official software likely has robust error handling you'll need to replicate.
*   **Writing Data:** Reading data is often easier to reverse engineer than writing data (configuration). Writing incorrect data could potentially brick the device or lead to incorrect operation. Be extremely careful if you attempt to implement writing capabilities.
*   **Legality:** While reverse engineering for interoperability is often legally permissible in many jurisdictions, check the "Газсеть" software license agreement for any clauses prohibiting it (though enforcing these can be difficult). You are creating your *own* software, not modifying theirs.
*   **No Support:** You will have no support from the manufacturer if things go wrong.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Start Simple:** Focus on the USB connection first.
2.  **Prioritize Reading:** Aim to read basic configuration and archive data initially. Writing parameters is much riskier.
3.  **Investigate RS485:** If you have a newer model with the external RS485 port, try connecting with standard Modbus tools first. See if you can read *any* data using standard Modbus function codes. This would be a much easier path *if* it's supported.
4.  **Use USB Sniffing:** Get familiar with Wireshark/USBPcap or a dedicated USB analyzer. Capture traffic for simple actions in Gazset.
5.  **Be Patient:** Analyze the captured data meticulously. Look for repeating patterns.

This is a significant undertaking, but potentially achievable if you have the necessary time and technical expertise. Good luck!
