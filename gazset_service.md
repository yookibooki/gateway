**Part 1: The Configuration Problem (The Hardest Part)**

*   **The Challenge:** The БПЭК needs to be *told* where your server is (IP address/domain name), the login details (FTP username/password), the APN for the SIM card, and the schedule for sending data. This is normally done via USB with "Газсеть: Сервис".
*   **Why it's Hard:** The communication protocol used over USB between "Газсеть: Сервис" and the БПЭК is likely proprietary and not publicly documented.
*   **Possible Solutions (Difficult):**
    1.  **Reverse Engineering:** You would need to capture the USB communication between the official software and the device and decode the commands to figure out how to send configuration settings yourself. This requires advanced skills and tools (USB analyzers, protocol analysis).
    2.  **Finding Documentation (Unlikely):** Search extensively for any leaked or unofficial documentation on the БПЭК's USB configuration protocol.
    3.  **Hardware Modification (Risky/Voids Warranty):** Trying to access configuration settings via other hardware interfaces (like internal UARTs) if they exist. Not recommended.
*   **The Most Practical Workaround:**
    *   **Get it Pre-Configured:** Can you get *someone* who *does* have "Газсеть: Сервис" (like the supplier, an integrator, or borrow temporary access) to configure the БПЭК *just once*? They would need to enter *your* server's details (IP/domain, FTP user/pass, APN) into the БПЭК using their software.
    *   **If pre-configuration is possible, you only need to build the *receiving* part.**

**Assuming you solve the configuration (e.g., via pre-configuration):**

**Part 2: Building Your Receiving Server Software**

The БПЭК will be pushing data, most likely via **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol), as this is a common method for such devices. It *might* support raw TCP, but FTP is often simpler for embedded devices to implement for file transfer. Your software needs to act as an **FTP Server**.

1.  **Choose a Programming Language/Platform:** Python, Node.js, C#, Java, Go are all suitable choices with good networking libraries.
2.  **Implement an FTP Server:**
    *   Use existing libraries for your chosen language to create an FTP server (e.g., `pyftpdlib` for Python, `ftp-srv` for Node.js, standard libraries in C#/Java).
    *   **Listen:** Configure your server to listen for incoming FTP connections on the standard port (21) or a custom port if needed (though the БПЭК likely uses port 21).
    *   **Authentication:** Configure the FTP server to require the *exact same username and password* that were programmed into the БПЭК.
    *   **File Reception:** When the БПЭК connects and uploads a file, your server needs to accept it and save it to a designated directory on your server machine.
    *   **Logging:** Implement logging to track connections, login attempts (successful/failed), and file uploads. This is crucial for troubleshooting.
3.  **Networking & Firewall:**
    *   Your server needs a **static IP address** or a **domain name** that the БПЭК can reliably connect to.
    *   You need to configure your server's firewall (and any network firewalls between the internet and your server) to **allow incoming connections** on the FTP port (e.g., port 21) from the internet (or specifically from the IP range used by the cellular provider's GPRS network, if possible).

**Part 3: Processing the Received Data**

1.  **Understanding the File Format:** This is the next big unknown. What format is the data file that the БПЭК uploads?
    *   It could be CSV (Comma Separated Values).
    *   It could be XML.
    *   It could be a custom binary format.
    *   It might be a format specific to the *corrector* device (TC220, Flougaz) that the БПЭК simply forwards.
    *   **How to find out?**
        *   If you get a sample file (e.g., during pre-configuration testing), examine it with text editors and hex editors.
        *   Look for documentation specifically about the *data archive format* of the connected *corrector* model.
2.  **Building a Parser:**
    *   Once you know the format, you need to write code (a parser) that reads the received file.
    *   This parser will extract the meaningful data points (timestamps, gas volume, pressure, temperature, sensor states, event codes, etc.).
3.  **Storing the Data:**
    *   Decide how to store the extracted data. Options include:
        *   **Database:** SQL (like PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (like InfluxDB - good for time-series data).
        *   **Simple Files:** Processed CSV files, JSON files.
4.  **Using the Data:**
    *   Build a web interface, dashboard, or reporting tool to view the stored data.
    *   Set up alerts based on data values if needed.

**Summary of Steps (If Pre-Configuration is Possible):**

1.  **Get БПЭК Pre-Configured:** Have someone use "Газсеть: Сервис" to program your Server IP/Domain, FTP User/Pass, APN, and schedule into the БПЭК.
2.  **Set Up Server Hardware:** A reliable computer connected to the internet with a static IP or domain name.
3.  **Develop FTP Server Software:** Write code to listen for FTP connections, authenticate the БПЭК, and save uploaded files.
4.  **Configure Network/Firewall:** Allow incoming FTP traffic to your server.
5.  **Determine Data Format:** Analyze the files received from the БПЭК.
6.  **Develop Data Parser:** Write code to read the files and extract the data.
7.  **Develop Data Storage:** Choose and implement a database or file storage method.
8.  **Develop User Interface/Reporting:** Create tools to view or use the data.
